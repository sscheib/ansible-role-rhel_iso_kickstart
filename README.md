rhel_iso_kickstart
=========

This role downloads any RHEL ISO from the [Red Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com) (or really any ISO) and optionally implants a Kickstart file into a custom ISO
which is build from the downloaded ISO.

The role requires a `checksum` to be set. This checksum can be retrieved for any ISO on the Red Hat Customer Portal and can be found on the respective download page of the ISO.
To download an ISO from the Red Hat Customer Portal you need to be a Red Hat subscriber. If you don't own any subscriptions, you can make use of 
[Red Hat's Developer Subscription](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/faqs-no-cost-red-hat-enterprise-linux) which is provided at no cost by Red Hat.

Once you are able to download from the Red Hat Customer Portal, you need to create a [Red Hat API Token](https://access.redhat.com/management/api) and pass it to this role via
`api_token`.
This role is loosely based on the instructions provided by Red Hat which explain how to download ISO images via `curl` from Red Hat's Customer Portal.
These instructions can be reviewed
[here](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/de-de/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/performing_a_standard_rhel_8_installation/downloading-beta-installation-images_installing-rhel)

Please note, despite the metadata at `meta/main.yml` specifying `EL` (Enterprise Linux) this role specifically works **only** for RHEL ISOs. It can probably be modified to work also
with Alma Linux or Rocky Linux, but that's a task somebody else needs to take care of, as I don't use either of those RHEL clones. The process of creating the custom ISO, however,
*should* remain the same (untested). 

Unfortunately, specifying `RHEL` as the operating system in `meta/main.yml` is not possible, as there is no distinction made between the RHEL clones and RHEL itself.

I have probably not tested every combination possible with the variables. If you find an issue, feel free to raise it or provide a pull request to fix it.

Provided with this role is an example Kickstart (for both UEFI and BIOS types of systems) that can be used as a start to building your own. This Kickstart implements the recommended Red Hat Satellite file system layout
[1](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.12/html/installing_satellite_server_in_a_connected_network_environment/preparing_your_environment_for_installation_satellite)

The `example-uefi.ks` can be used for *both* UEFI and BIOS systems, but is a little more complexer due to the nature of supporting both UEFI and BIOS. Including also the `example.ks` which *only* supports BIOS.

## Notes

A note on `force_recreate_custom_iso`:
This variable defines whether to delete the custom ISO before recreating it. Once the custom ISO file exists, it won't be recreated, even if there are changes. 
That's because creating the ISO makes use of the command module and thus the operation is not idempotent, nor can it be checked whether the ISO should be recreated due to changes.

Note on `users` and `post_sections`:
The `users` variable can be used to deploy users during kickstart. If those users have one or more `authorized_keys` set, and the default value of `post_section` is kept
or extended, these users will have the set authorized keys deployed in `home` (also a variable for the `users` list) within the `.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

Please also note, that by default, all plays in a task that could reveal a secret value have the `no_log: true` option set to ensure no sensitive data is logged anywhere. If you
debug the playbook, please comment the `no_log: true` portion of that specific task.

## Variables `users` and `post_sections`

An extended example of only the `users` variable is illustrated down below:
```
users:
  - name: 'ansible-user'          # name of the user (required)
    gid: 2000                     # ID of the user group to create (with the same name as the user name)
    uid: 2000                     # ID of the user
    gecos: 'Ansible User'         # user's description/comment 
    create_user_group: true       # whether to create a user group (with a specific gid or without)
    groups:                       # additional groups to add the user to - these need to *exist*
      - 'wheel'
    shell: '/bin/bash'            # login shell to use
    home: '/home/remote-ansible'  # home directory
    privileged: true              # enables creation of a sudoers.d file which grants sudo privileges without a password (created by the post section template 'post__users.j2')
    lock: false                   # whether to lock the user
    password: !vault |            # the user's password. If not specified, the user account is locked by default!
          $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
          [..]
    authorized_keys:              # SSH public keys to add to the user's authorized_keys file (~/.ssh/authorized_keys)
      - !vault |
          $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
          [..]
      - !vault |
          $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
          [..]
```
The only required option for a user is the `name`. Everything else can be mixed and matched.

An example of the `post_section` (which represents the default value):
```
post_sections:
  - name: 'User creation'        # will be used by Ansible as the 'beginning- and end marker' (see ansible.builtin.blockinfile)
    template: 'post__users.j2'   # the actual template to use

  - name: 'FIPS'
    template: 'post__fips.j2'

  - name: 'Autorelabel'
    template: 'post__autorelabel.j2'
```

It is important to understand that `%post` sections in Kickstart are evaluated top to bottom. So `User Creation` is the first `%post`-section and `Autorelabel` the last.
To extend the current default with your own `%post sections` you could specify the following in e.g. your `host_vars`:
```
post_sections: >
  {{
     _def_post_sections +
     [
       {
         'name': 'Custom %post section'
         'template: 'custom_post.j2'
       },
       {
         'name': 'Another %post section'
         'template: 'another_post.j2'
       }
     ]
  }}
```

If you want to make it more readable and don't mind duplicating the definition of `_def_post_sections`:
```
post_sections:
  - name: 'User creation'
    template: 'post__users.j2'

  - name: 'FIPS'
    template: 'post__fips.j2'

  - name: 'Autorelabel'
    template: 'post__autorelabel.j2'

  - name: 'Custom %post section'
    template: 'custom_post.j2'

  - name: 'Another %post section'
    template: 'another_post.j2'
```



Depending on the value of `implant_md5`, different menu entries are selected when booting from the ISO:
* When `implant_md5` is set to `false` the ISO will be booted without checking the MD5 (which would fail)
* When `implant_md5` is set to `true` the ISO will be booted with `rd.live.check` which will calculate the MD5 checksum of the ISO and compare it against the implanted one

Dependencies
------------

This role makes use of the [Ansible Posix collection](https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.posix).
Depending on whether certain actions are required, the role needs to install the following packages:
- `rsync`: To extract files from mounted ISO to work directory
- `xorriso`: To create a custom ISO
- `isomd5sum`: To implant a MD5 checksum into a custom ISO
- `pykickstart`: To validate a given Kickstart file
Depending on whether a custom ISO is created (when implanting a kickstart), the package `xorriso` is installed.
Further, implanting a MD5 checksum into the custom ISO requires the package `isomd5sum`.
